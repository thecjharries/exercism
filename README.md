## Online Tracks

I (so far) do not do these tracks locally for a variety of reasons.

- [Gleam](https://exercism.org/tracks/gleam): The Gleam compiler won't build in Rust and provides zero documentation for fixes
- [MIPS Assembly](https://exercism.org/tracks/mips): I don't want to deal with assembly
- [Pharo](https://exercism.org/tracks/pharo-smalltalk): I'm not dealing with their convoluted VM setup
